                    <h2>How much does professional video production cost in Canada?</h2>
                    <p>Video production costs in Canada vary significantly based on project scope, duration, location, crew size, equipment requirements, and post-production complexity. Basic corporate interview videos typically start around $5,000 CAD, while mid-range commercial productions range from $15,000 to $50,000 CAD. Large-scale commercial campaigns or music videos can cost $50,000 to $200,000+ CAD depending on creative requirements, talent, locations, and production value. Factors affecting cost include shooting days, crew size, equipment rental, travel expenses, location fees, talent costs, post-production time, and deliverable formats. We provide detailed, transparent quotes for every project after understanding your specific needs and budget parameters.</p>

                    <h2>Do you travel for shoots across provinces and territories, and are travel costs included in quotes?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, we provide video production services across all Canadian provinces and territories. We have crew networks in major cities including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Halifax, and Quebec City, which helps minimize travel costs for many projects. For remote locations or specialized shoots, we include all travel expenses in our project quotes including flights, accommodation, meals, equipment transportation, and per diems. Travel costs are always disclosed upfront in our detailed estimates, so there are no surprises. We also work with local crews when possible to reduce costs while maintaining our quality standards. Our project managers coordinate all logistics to ensure smooth productions regardless of location.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How long does it take to deliver a finished video after filming?</h2>
                    <p>Delivery timelines depend on project complexity and post-production requirements. Simple corporate videos or interviews typically take 1-2 weeks after filming for editing and delivery. Standard commercial projects usually require 2-4 weeks for complete post-production including editing, colour grading, sound mixing, and revisions. Complex projects with extensive motion graphics, animation, or multiple deliverable formats may take 4-8 weeks. Music videos and creative projects often require 3-6 weeks depending on the creative vision and effects work. We provide realistic timelines during project planning and keep clients updated throughout the post-production process. Rush delivery is available for urgent projects with additional fees. All timelines include standard revision rounds as outlined in our contracts.</p>

                    <h2>How do we book a shoot date, and what deposit or contract terms are typical in Canada?</h2>
                    <p>Booking a shoot begins with an initial consultation to discuss your project requirements, timeline, and budget. We then provide a detailed proposal including scope of work, timeline, deliverables, and pricing. Once approved, we prepare a comprehensive production contract outlining all terms, responsibilities, and deliverables. Our standard terms require a 50% deposit upon contract signing to secure your shoot dates and begin pre-production work. The remaining balance is due upon delivery of final assets. We accept payment by cheque, bank transfer, or credit card. Cancellation policies vary based on notice period, with full refunds available for cancellations more than 14 days before scheduled filming. We recommend booking 3-4 weeks in advance for standard projects, though rush projects can often be accommodated with additional fees.</p>
